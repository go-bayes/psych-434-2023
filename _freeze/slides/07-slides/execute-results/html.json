Understand the definition of \"causality\" as it is used in the human and health sciences.\n2.  Understand the assumptions required for consistently estimating causal effects. \n3.  Understand how to use causal diagrammes to assess these assumptions.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1.  Cause/Effect\n2.  Confounder \n3.

Why might this be the case? \n\n- How can we know whether it is bilingualism that causes better performance on various cognitive tasks? \n\n\n## Hume's definitions of a causality \n\n\n> “we may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second [definition 1]. Or, in other words, **where, if the first object had not been, the second never would have existed** [definition 2].” - David Hume, Enquiries Concerning Human Understanding, and Concerning the Principles of Morals, Section VII\n\n\n## Individual causal effects\n\n$Y_i^{a = 1}$: The cognitive ability of child $i$ if they were bilingual.  This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 1.\n\n$Y_i^{a = 0}$: The cognitive ability of child $i$ if they were monolingual. This is the counterfactual outcome when A = 0.\n\n$$\n\\text{Causal Effect}_i = Y^{a = 1} - Y^{a = 0} \n$$\n\n##  Individual causal quantities\n\nWe say there is a causal effect for individual $i$ if: \n\n$$\nY_i^{a=1} - Y_i^{a=0}  \\neq 0\n$$\n\n## What is the problem? \n\n- These data required to compute this quantity is generally not available.\n\n\n## Two Roads Diverge in a Yellow Wood\n\nRobert Frost writes, \n\n>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n\n>And sorry I could not travel both\u000b\n\n>And be one traveler, long I stood\u000b\n\n>And looked down one as far as I could\u000b\n\n>To where it bent in the undergrowth;\u000b\n\n\n\n>Then took the other, as just as fair,\u000b\n\n>And having perhaps the better claim,\u000b\n\n>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;\u000b\n\n>Though as for that the passing there\u000b\n\n>Had worn them really about the same,\u000b\n\u000b\n\n>And both that morning equally lay\u000b\n\n>In leaves no step had trodden black.\u000b\n\n>Oh, I kept the first for another day!\u000b\n\n>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,\u000b\n\n\n>I doubted if I should ever come back.\u000b\n\n>I shall be telling this with a sigh\u000b\n\n>Somewhere ages and ages hence:\u000b\n\n>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—\u000b\n\n>I took the one less traveled by,\u000b\n\n>And that has made all the difference. \n\n> Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken\n\n## How can we identify causal effects?

Assign time indices to your variables.\n- Organize your variables chronologically.\n- Simplify your graph by removing unnecessary nodes that don't impact the assessment of bias between an exposure and an outcome.\n- Keep in mind that Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are qualitative tools. They don't represent non-linear associations or interactions. \n- Avoid depicting interactions by crossing arrows.\n- Remember that DAGs are distinct from graphs used in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Be cautious of SEM literature, as it often overlooks the assumptions needed for causal inference.\n\n\n## Summary: Drawing Causal Graphs (DAGs)\n\n- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) help visualize sources of bias.\n\n- There are five main sources of bias:\n  1. Temporal order ambiguity: Uncertainty about whether causes precede effects. Solution: Collect time series data or clarify assumptions when unavailable.\n  2. Common causes of exposure and outcome: Address this by including common causes in your statistical model (e.g., using regression).\n  3. Conditioning on a mediator: Avoid this unless mediation is of interest.\n  4. Conditioning on a collider: Refrain from doing this.\n  5. Bias induced by conditioning on a confounder's descendant: Draw your DAG and follow guidelines for points 1-4.\n\n- Important Note 1: In observational studies, it's impossible to guarantee complete control for confounding. Always conduct sensitivity analyses. Techniques for sensitivity analyses will be discussed next week.\n\n- Important Note 2: Methods for computing causal effects for group comparisons will be covered in the following week's lecture.\n\n\n## What have we learned? \n\n\n1.  Cause/Effect: a contrast between the world under different interventions, at most one of which is realised. \n2.  Confounding: failure to condition on a common cause.\n3.  Collider bias: conditioning on a common effect\n\n\n\n\n\n:::{.notes}\nMetric equivalence: Factor loadings are similar across groups.\nConfigural equivalence: The factor structure is the same across groups in a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis.\nScalar equivalence: Values/Means are also equivalent across groups.\n:::\n",
